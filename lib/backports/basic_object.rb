# Note: Must be required explicitely!
# This is a best attempt to fake BasicObject in Ruby 1.8.x
# What you do get:
#  * as few methods as the real BasicObject (at the moment the library is required...)
#  * BasicObject === <anything> # ==> returns true
# What you don't get:
#  * BasicObject is not in the ancestor list of all classes and thus
#  * Comparisons between classes won't work, e.g.
#      Object < BasicObject # ==> returns true instead of false
#  * Instance methods added to Object or Kernel after you require 'backports/basic_object'
#    might also be available in instances of BasicObject and subclasses
#    (they will only be undefined whenever a subclass of BasicObject is created)
# Because of all the fineprint, BasicObject must be required explicitely
